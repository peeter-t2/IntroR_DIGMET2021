#' - unique() - keep only unique rows
#' - arrange() - sort the data by some parameter

#If we happen to restart R, then we need to activate the library agian, and read the data into it again.

gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder.csv")




# It is often the case that the information we want to use is not exactly present in the dataset, but needs to be created.

#' For this we have the following commands
#' mutate() - make a new column with some function

# The column that we create can be very simple. For example, we can make a column "ourdata". This may be useful if we want to combine it with some other data.

gapminder %>% 
  mutate(set="ourdata")

# Or simply 1
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(set=1)

# We can also use other columns to calculate these values. For example, we have population pop and gdp per capita gdpPercap. If we multiply them, we get the full gdp.
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp=gdpPercap*pop)

# We can now sort the table by gpd
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp=gdpPercap*pop) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp))

# The leader position does not belong to Kuwait in 1952 by this metric.

# We can use this like we used other metrics before, and make a top 10 countries by their top gdp.
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp=gdpPercap*pop) %>% 
  arrange(desc(gdp)) %>% 
  select(country,continent) %>% 
  unique()


# mutate() needs to take variables that are either with a length of 1 or with the length of a dataset.
# Thus we can also give each row a number.
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(sequencepos=1:1704)


# Given that we know that there are 142 countries in the set, with 12 years each, we can also give the observations numbers 1:12 for each country by using a special function for repetitions rep().
gapminder %>% 
  select(country) %>% 
  unique()

gapminder %>% 
  mutate(sequencecountry=rep(1:12,142))

# Generally we might not know the exact contents of the dataset, and for this, more flexible functions are made.

# A generally useful function for the datasets is group_by(). With this function, we can do operations on the dataset in groups. 

# For example we can group the dataset by country.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country)

# And give each year a row number within a country.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(sequencecountry=row_number())


# There are a number of useful functions that can be applied here. 
# We can use max() for maximum value, min() for minimum value, row_number() for row number, mean() for mean() value, sd() for standard deviation etc, first() for first value, last() for last value, n() for a count of how many, log() for the value in logarithmic scale.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(sequenceincountry=row_number())


# For example, if we want to add a column for a population at the first year in the dataset. For this, we place the name of the variable we want to use inside the function.
# first(), mean(), median() etc are functions that work on lists of values.
numbers <- c(2,3,4,1:11,26)
numbers %>% 
  first()

numbers %>% 
  last()

numbers %>% 
  min()

numbers %>% 
  mean()

numbers %>% 
  median()


# We can then take within a group, the first value for population. I.e. the first value for population for each country.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(firstpop=first(pop))

#If we do not have the grouping variable, it will pick the first population total for the entire dataset. 
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(firstpop=first(pop))


# We can use this to look at the maximum life expectancy at any point.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(maxlife=max(lifeExp))


# And we can then use the filter to find the exact years when this was the case.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(maxlife=max(lifeExp)) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp==maxlife)

# It is interesting to know, if there is a country, where it is not the year 2007
see <-gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  mutate(maxlife=max(lifeExp)) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp==maxlife) %>% 
  filter(year<2007)
# In fact it seems there are a number of countries, mostly in Africa, where the life expectancy has not been increasing in the 2000s
# We can also have a look graphically.

see %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=lifeExp,color=continent))+
  geom_point()


# Ok, we have seen mutate() and we have seen group_by(). A third relevant command for computing new values from the dataset is summarise(). summarise() is essentially mutate(), however it will only leave the summary values and grouping factors.

# For example, we can summarise to find the top population value.
gapminder %>% 
  summarise(pop=max(pop))
# It returns just that value. If we want the maximal value by population, we group by country.

# And we get a maximal population value there.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(pop=max(pop))


# This can be combined with other calculations.
gapminder %>% 
  summarise(maxgdp = max(pop * gdpPercap))

gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>% 
  summarise(maxgdp = max(gdp))


# And it is also possible to create multiple value columns at the same time.

gapminder %>% 
  summarise(maxpop=max(pop), maxgdppercap=max(gdpPercap), maxgdp = max(pop * gdpPercap))



# group_by also impacts how filters work. Filters in a way allow for simple calculations to be done within them.
# We can get the minimum gdp per capita per country like this quite easily.
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(gdpPercap==min(gdpPercap))


# Another way that this can be accomplished can be through sorting
gapminder %>% 
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(row_number()==1) %>% 
  arrange(country)


# It is generally a good idea to remove the grouping condition once it is no longer needed. It sometimes can interfere with commands from other packages and bring unexpected results. This can be done by adding ungroup() at the end.
gapminder %>% 
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  filter(row_number()==1) %>% 
  arrange(country) %>% 
  ungroup()
# You can see that the grouping variable is no longer there
# No more: "Groups:   country [142]"


# Try it yourself!
# mutate() - create a new variable
# group_by() - group by a variable
# summarise() - create a summary variable, drop the other data.

# 1. Make a new variable row number.

# 2. Pick a year, group the dataset by continent, sort it by life expectancy, and create a new variable: the relative position of a country within the continent.

# 3. Find the top 3 countries within each continent.

# 4. Find the maximal gdp per continent.

# 5. Find the countries, where the maximal gdp per capita is more than 9 times bigger than minimal gdp per capita recorded




# Summary tables

# The summarise() function combined with group_by() is quite good for making summary tables. For example, we can retrieve the maximal gdp per continent or per country.
gapminder %>% 
  mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap) %>%

gapminder %>%

# We can use these values to determine the ranks of the countires on some parameters. rank() is a shorter version for this, that could be expressed longer as a sequence of arrange() and mutate(rank=row_number()).
gapminder %>%

  mutate(rank=rank(-mean_gdpPercap))


# Keep in mind that if we filter the dataset without groups, then any function will work on the entire dataset. For example row_number()<10 takes the first 10 rows from the dataset. Using mean() as a basis of the filter, the table will use all observations at the same time (table mean is 29.6 millions). If we now try to filter on this, we get 0 rows, if we test for lower than, then we get all rows.

gapminder %>% 
  filter(row_number()<10)

gapminder %>%

gapminder %>%

#' But we can do the same after grouping the dataset, and get first 5 rows per country row_number()<5 or all the information on the countries where the mean population is above 30 million, mean(pop)>30000000. sample_n() will give us that number of observations from each group.

# 4 first years for each country
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%

# Countries where the mean population is above 30 million
gapminder %>%

# 1. Pick a country and store its data in a separate variable.

# 2. Take two random years, and keep only the year with a larger gdp per capita.

# 3. Get european data from the year 2007, and calculate mean life expectancy, median of population and least gdppercap Hint: mean(), median(), min()

# 4. Take the data stored in point one, and add a new variable that shows how much larger is its gdppercap in 2007 from 1952

# 5. Find all countries within Europe that have had a life expectancy over 75 for at least 20 years before 2007.
