## Introduction to R and Tidyverse - Peeter Tinits
- Lecturer: Peeter Tinits (peeter.tinits@ut.ee)
- Date: 23.08.2021

### Description
R is a scripting language often used for data processing in humanities and social sciences. It provides the means to produce analyses as a reproducible workflow that is transparent to readers and easy to update. We will start with the very basics of R and RStudio, and quickly work our way through to simple data processing via Tidyverse packages. Tidyverse is a set of packages that aims to make R easy to use, especially for beginners. We will learn basic R syntax, data manipulation and overviews in Tidyverse style.
We will rely on personal laptops in this tutorial, you will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org) and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com) a few days beforehand. Short instructions will be shared.

If you do not have previous experience in R, this workshop is a requirement for attending other workshops using R at this summer school.
